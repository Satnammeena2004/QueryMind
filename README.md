# QueryMind

This project is a Next.js application that allows users to query a PostgreSQL database using natural language and visualize the results. It's powered by the AI SDK by Vercel and uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to translate natural language queries into SQL.

## Features

- Natural Language to SQL: Users can input queries in plain English, which are then converted to SQL using AI.
- Data Visualization: Results are displayed in both table and chart formats, with the chart type automatically selected based on the data.
- Query Explanation: Users can view the full SQL query and get an AI-generated explanation of each part of the query.
- User can upload their data source json or csv file

## Technology Stack

- Next.js for the frontend and API routes
- AI SDK by Vercel for AI integration
- OpenAI's GPT-4o for natural language processing
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Vercel Postgres for database hosting
- Framer Motion for animations
- ShadowUI for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization

## How It Works

1. The user enters a natural language query about unicorn companies.
2. The application uses GPT-4 to generate an appropriate SQL query.
3. The SQL query is executed against the PostgreSQL database.
4. Results are displayed in a table format.
5. An AI-generated chart configuration is created based on the data.
6. The results are visualized using the generated chart configuration.
7. Users can toggle between table and chart views.
8. Users can request an explanation of the SQL query, which is also generated by AI.

## Demo Unicorns Data

The database contains information about unicorn companies, including:

- Company name
- Valuation
- Date joined (unicorn status)
- Country
- City
- Industry
- Select investors

This data is based on CB Insights' list of unicorn companies.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add your OpenAI API key and PostgreSQL connection string to the `.env` file:

   ```
   POSTGRES_URL="..."
   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_FREE_CREDITS_LITMIT=""
   NEXT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=""

   ```

4. Download the dataset:

- Go to https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies
- Download the unicorn companies dataset
- Save the file as `unicorns.csv` in the root of your project

5. Seed the database:

   ```bash
   pnpm run seed
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

Your project should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
